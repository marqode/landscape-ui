/**
 * Integration test: publication targets (debarchive service)
 *
 * WHAT THIS TESTS
 * ───────────────
 * Verifies that the debarchive service is reachable and that seed data created
 * by the debarchive-seeder container (4 publication targets: "Dev S3 Bucket",
 * "Staging S3 Bucket", "Prod S3 Bucket", "Swift Store") is visible in the UI.
 *
 * The publication targets page calls GET /v1beta1/publicationTargets via the
 * Vite dev proxy (VITE_API_DEBARCHIVE_PROXY_TARGET → http://localhost:8000).
 * This exercises the full request path: React → useFetchDebArchive → Vite proxy
 * → landscape-debarchive container.
 *
 * AUTH
 * ────
 * The debarchive service uses its own JWT auth (not the Landscape session
 * cookie). The UI's useFetchDebArchive hook manages this transparently, so the
 * storageState from global-setup is sufficient.
